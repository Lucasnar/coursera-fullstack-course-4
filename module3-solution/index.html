        Did you know?<br><br>
        This bird was probably first domesticated for the purpose of cockfights, not as food.
        Chickens aren’t completely flightless—they can get airborne enough to make it over a fence or into a tree.
        These birds are omnivores. They’ll eat seeds and insects but also larger prey like small mice and lizards.
        With 25 billion chickens in the world, there are more of them than any other bird species.
        There are dozens of chicken breeds, such as the Dutch bantam, leghorn and Rhode Island red.
        Baby chickens are chicks. Female chickens are pullets until they’re old enough to lay eggs and become hens. Male chickens are called roosters, cocks or cockerels, depending on the country you’re in.
        A rooster announces to a flock of chickens that he’s found food with a “took, took, took.” But the hens don’t pay attention if they already know that there is food around.
        Roosters perform a little dance called ‘tidbitting’ in which they make sounds (food calls) and move their head up and down, picking up and dropping a bit of food. Researchers have found that females prefer males that often perform tidbitting and have larger, brighter combs on top of their heads.
        Scientists think that the rooster’s wattle–the dangly bit beneath his beak–helps him to gain a hen’s attention when he is tidbitting.
         A female chicken will mate with many different males but if she decides, after the deed is done, that she doesn’t want a particular rooster’s offspring and can eject his sperm. This occurs most often when the male is lower in the pecking order.
         The chicken was the first bird to have its genome sequenced, in 2004.
         Avian influenza (a.k.a. bird flu) is extremely contagious and can make chickens very sick and kill them. The highly pathogenic form of the disease can kill off 90 to 100 percent of birds in a flock in just 48 hours.

         Chickens can be tamed by hand feeding and by being handled. Some people are afraid that roosters will become aggressive, but this problem can easily be avoided if the rooster is handled properly.[5] Breeds such as Silkies and many bantams are generally docile, making them ideal pets for owners with small children.[6] Some cities in the United States allow chickens as pets but others ban them. Some may only ban roosters due to the crowing.[7] City ordinances, zoning regulations or health boards may determine whether chickens may be kept.[8] A general requirement is that the birds be confined to the owner's property, not allowed to roam freely. There may be restrictions on the size of the property or how far from human dwellings a coop may be located, etc.[9] Hens continue to lay eggs in the absence of a rooster, but like most supermarket eggs, they are unfertilized.
         The so-called "urban hen movement" harks back to the days when chicken keeping was much more common, and involves the keeping of small groups of hens in areas where they may not be expected, such as closely populated cities and suburban areas. Some people end up keeping urban hens as pets after they reach henopause, or cease laying eggs. In the UK a charity, the British Hen Welfare Trust, rescues commercial hens who would otherwise be sent to slaughter when they become no longer commercially viable. Supporters of the charity adopt the birds as family pets, with the intention of providing them a "retirement". In Asia, chickens with striking plumage have long been kept for ornamental purposes, including feather-footed varieties such as the Cochin and the Silkie from China, and the extremely long-tailed Phoenix from Japan. Asian ornamental varieties were imported into the United States and Great Britain in the late 1800s. Distinctive American varieties of chickens have been developed from these Asian breeds. Poultry fanciers began keeping these ornamental birds for exhibition, a practice that continues today. Individuals in rural communities commonly keep chickens for both ornamental and practical value. The rarest breed in Britain is the famous Scots Dumpy.
         In Hong Kong, keeping chickens and other poultry without a licence has been banned since 2006 because of the threat of avian flu, whether as pets or for consumption. Only licensed farms are legally allowed to keep chickens and other poultry.[11]
